-  1.2 [Selection Sort]("https://github.com/Rana0Ahmed/Data-Structures/tree/main/1-Sorting%20Algorithms/Selection%20Sort")

## Why Sorting Algorithms
-  Sorting in C++ is a concept in which the elements of an array are rearranged in a logical order. This order can be from lowest to highest or highest to lowest. Sorting an unsorted array helps to solve many problems such as searching for the minimum or maximum element, etc.

-  Arranging things in a sorted manner makes it easier to analyze and search for a particular element among the collection of elements
